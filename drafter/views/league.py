IN THE VIEW:
When the client-side code decides to open a WebSocket, it contacts the HTTP server to obtain an authorization "ticket".   
The server generates this ticket. It typically contains some sort of user/account ID, the IP of the client requesting the ticket, a timestamp, and any other sort of internal record-keeping you might need.
The server stores this ticket (i.e. in a database or cache), and also returns it to the client.
    We open a websocket when the draft page is opened, thus we can create this ticket in the draft view
    We save the ticket pass the generated ticket to the context and send it to the websocket
IN THE SOCKET:
The client opens the WebSocket connection, and sends along this "ticket" as part of an initial handshake.
The server can then compare this ticket, check source IPs, verify that the ticket hasn't been re-used and hasn't expired, and do any other sort of permission checking. If all goes well, the WebSocket connection is now verified.
